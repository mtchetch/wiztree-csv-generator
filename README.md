# wiztree-csv-generator
A Linux shell script for generating  [Wiztree](https://diskanalyzer.com/) compatible CSV listings.

The csv file can be generated on a remote server and imported to Wiztree for analysis. The Linux-style paths are converted to Windows paths on the X:\ drive in order for Wiztree to process the file.
